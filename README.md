# Reality Capture and 3D Modelling

Welcome to the repository for the Feasibility Study on Precise 3D Models of Cars in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). This research project aims to bridge the knowledge gap caused by the limited Fields of View (FOVs) of surveillance cameras in ITS, which provide incomplete information about vehicles. By leveraging photogrammetry, a technique that combines images from multiple perspectives, we propose a method to create accurate and complete 3D models of observed vehicles. These models will enhance vehicle recognition, tracking, and provide valuable insights into traffic patterns and behavior. Join us on this journey to contribute to advancements in road safety, emergency response systems, and traffic management.
